# Library Book Management System (LBMS)

The Library Book Management System (LBMS) is a local desktop Java application that helps librarians and library members complete common library tasks efficiently, including login authentication, catalog search, and checkout/return workflows.

This project is built by Group 2 using:

- Java
- JavaFX
- JDBC
- MySQL and MySQL Workbench
- diagrams.net (for ERD design)

The project follows a layered architecture with clear separation between the user interface, business logic, and data access layers.

## How to Run Everything

Requirements: Install Java JDK 17, Maven, MySQL Community Server 8.0, MySQL Workbench, and Git


Run MySQL Server and run the scripts in the /db files ([drop-all-tables.sql] -> mysql-ddl.sql -> views.sql -> seed-data.sql) in Workbench


Make sure your database is called "LBMS" and your user/pass is "root" "root"

OR edit src/main/java/lbms/utils/DBConnection.java to match your database name and login info


Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/erikbarbieri/library-book-management-system.git
```

Make sure you are in the repository's directory:
```
cd library-book-management-system
```

Compile the application:
```
mvn clean compile
```

Run the application:
```
mvn exec:java
```


The application will start, and you can login as "admin_demo" "admin123" or as "member_demo" "member123" to demo the application
There's currently no logout button, so close and re-run the application if you wish to demo both admin (librarian) and member (library member)
